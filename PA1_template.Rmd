## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
count_steps_per_date <- data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(count_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
hist(count_steps_per_date$count_steps,
     main = "Histogram of total number of steps per day",
     xlab = "Total number of steps per day")
cat(paste0("The mean of total number of steps per day is: ",  mean(count_steps_per_date$count_steps)))
cat(paste0("The median of total number of steps per day is: ",  median(count_steps_per_date$count_steps)))
```
